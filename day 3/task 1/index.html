    I am Abidha Shree, a skillful full-stack developer, pursuing  B.Tech in Information Technology at SNS College of Engineering.I was a biology student in school, so I initially struggled to understand how coding works. I started learning through online platforms, which motivated me to overcome these struggles. I wrote my first code in my second semester, and I still remember how excited I was to see if it would work. 
    It was a simple web page, but it sparked my interest in full-stack development.As a result, I have completed my internship as full-stack developer at webGen Technology.
    I am eager to start my career as a full-stack developer and apply my skills to build user-friendly applications.
